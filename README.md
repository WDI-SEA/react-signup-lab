Forms are something you will frequently use in `React.js`.

This lab uses what students have learned so far to create a sign up form using React.js and a component framework other than the ones we have worked with (reactstrap and Material UI).

---

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:

-   React and React components
-   File tree and component structure
-   State
-   Props
-   Unidirectional data flow
-   Using documentation

## Instructions

1. Create a react app
2. Find a React Framework the looks interesting to you
3. Read their Documentation to find out how to create a form
4. Create a github repo
5. Push your react code to your github
6. Send your instructor the link to your repo

## Requirements

Build a sign up form using `create-react-app` and a UI Framework of your choice to collect the name, email, picture, and hidden password for a user. `console.log` what the user's inputs when they submit the form.

You should have:

* A Readme that talks about the Framework you're using, how you found it and why you chose it
* Three text input fields: Name, Email, Password
* File upload input
* One Button to Submit input
* Submit should have a listener event that triggers a function and `console.log`s the user's input and the blob for the image.

> NOTE: This form doesn't actually do anything. It is for styling practice.

## Bonus

- Add custom styles and a "logo" to personalize the site.
- Show custom error messages for incomplete fields
- Show a success alert when the form is submitted
- Implement icons to add to your from [React Font Awesome 5](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)
- Put your form into a modal
- Validate that the email is a valid email address
